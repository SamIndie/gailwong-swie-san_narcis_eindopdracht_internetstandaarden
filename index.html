          <h2>about</h2>
            <p>Whenever I would feel like it, I intentionally started looking for pretty frames in nature, so I could combine my love for nature with these intentional words. I started to play with my camera, with editing apps, with frames, filters, etc.</p>
            <p>People started noticing the words and reflected back that the words really did help them daily. They connected with them in many different ways. Some people used them as reminders of things they needed to stand for that day, concepts to reflect on in their behaviours and others just use it as a way to be a bit more present through that word in their day.</p>
            <p>With word of the day, I want to encourage people to be a bit more conscious of where they are at. Check in with what they feel, what they need to become a bit more aware of themselves and others, every single day.</p>
